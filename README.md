# Games:
## Worldless
A 2d platformer metroidvania with rhythm based combat. It's about 6-7 hours long and "free".

## In Stars and Time
An interesting RPG adventure about a group of heroes fighting to defeat the King, who has the power to stop time!

## Unbeatable
A heartfelt, story-driven rhythm game. It's about losing oneself, dealing with grief, and beating the shit out of cops.

## Depersonalization
A Call of Chtulhu based RPG. Has well-written and branching, if short, storylines. It suffers from a bad english translation, though.

## Blazblue Entropy Effect
2D platforming roguelike based on the Blazblue fighting game franchise. With plenty of characters and plenty of abilities, customization determines not just power, but combo length!

## Unicorn Overlord
A Nintendo Switch title. Incredible unit-based strategy game, with semi-realtime mechanics. The story kinda sucks, but the gameplay is fun and stays fresh.

## Etrian Odyssey
An Atlus (Persona, Shin Megami Tensei) franchise, with a relatively fresh take on the old, Wizardry style of dungeon crawling. Many classes, deep personalization.

## Hollow Knight Silksong
PLAY THE GAME BROTHER.

## Monster Hunter: World
It's great, you know it. It's multiplayer, and fantastic. PLAY THIS WITH ME. PLEASE.

## Guilty Gear Strive
Fighting games are fun and competitive, with plenty of depth. Guilty Gear is also one of the major fighting games around, so queue times are shorter than, I don't know, Melty Blood?

## Styx Master of Shadows
I just realized the game exists, 12 years after it came out. I got a short of it while mindlessly consuming content to destress a couple days ago, actually. Also, it's a stealth game sort of like Hitman.

## Deponia    

# Music:
# Disclaimer: Yes, I know most of this is JPOP. I do, in fact, like JPOP.
# Second disclaimer: it's "Artist - Song". It's the reverse because I want you to forget and feel dumb when you expect the first part to be the song.

## AHUB - The Clumsies

## Natsuyama Yotsugi
basically any song. Yes, it's all vocaloid.

## Pinata - Q&A
Yes, it's still vocaloid.

## Flavor Foley
EVERY. SONG. Of course it's still vocaloid. English, this time!

## Jamie Paige 
The artist in general, though the jingle gets a little annoying. Would you be surprised if I told you it's vocaloid? She's part of Flavor Foley, by the way.

## Vane Lily
Anything, but I personally enjoy "Six Feet Under". Still vocaloid.

## Riproducer - Man in the Mirror
is pretty fun. The rest gets a little too weird for me. Surprise! It's vocaloid!

## dada - Ambassador
The vocaloid is almost over, I swear.

## masarada - Irregular Man
Mostly because of the MV, it's really funny. One more vocaloid and I'm done, please bear with me.
## nunununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununu
Yes, that's their name. They mostly make joke songs, but they're actually pretty catchy.
## Azsagawa - Tokyo Suicide
This song had me at the cover, but it's got some really enjoyable piano. This is not vocaloid.
## Yoshino - Sandpaper Moon
It's swing-ish? I love swing-ish songs.
## The Vanished People
They're italian! Music's all in english. They made some good songs, feeling almost.. dreamy? As of 19/1/2026, though, they got a bit stale. I personally prefer "Parlami", "S!cK" and "Soul Vacation".
## bitbreaker - God Only Knows
Did I say vocaloid was over? It's not. It's somewhere between hard rock and metal, but with Kasane Teto.
## Hiroyuki Sawano - INERTIA, PARAGON
Have you watched To Be Hero X? No? Do it.
## MAFUYU - New Type Of Hero
WATCH THE SHOW GODDAMNIT.
## Altercad - Problems
Real depression, here. Also, it's vocaloid.
